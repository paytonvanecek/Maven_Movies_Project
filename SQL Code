-- All data is before 11-27-2012 as that is when request came in

-- 1) Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver. Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions and orders so that we can showcase growth there?

SELECT YEAR(ws.created_at) AS Year,
	MONTH(ws.created_at) AS MONTH,
	COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) AS sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders
FROM website_sessions ws
	LEFT JOIN orders o
		ON ws.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE ws.utm_source = 'gsearch'
	AND ws.created_at < '2012-11-27'
GROUP BY 1,2;
-- Gsearch sessions and orders growing are substaintially over time, orders have grown about 4x

-- 2) see similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time break out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately.
SELECT YEAR(ws.created_at) AS Year,
	MONTH(ws.created_at) AS MONTH,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ws.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN ws.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ws.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ws.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN ws.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand_sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ws.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand_orders
FROM website_sessions ws
	LEFT JOIN orders o
		ON ws.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE ws.utm_source = 'gsearch'
	AND ws.created_at < '2012-11-27'
GROUP BY 1,2;
-- Brand campaigns represent someone searching specifically for your business. This has dramatically increased over time, meaning our brand is growing.

-- 3) While on Gsearch, dive into nonbrand, pull out monthly sessions and orders split by device type? Want to identify our traffic sources
SELECT YEAR(ws.created_at) AS Year,
	MONTH(ws.created_at) AS MONTH,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ws.device_type = 'mobile' THEN ws.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ws.device_type = 'mobile' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_orders,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ws.device_type = 'desktop' THEN ws.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ws.device_type = 'desktop' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_orders
FROM website_sessions ws
	LEFT JOIN orders o
		ON ws.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE ws.utm_source = 'gsearch'
	AND ws.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
	AND ws.created_at < '2012-11-27'
GROUP BY 1,2;

-- We see many more desktop sessions, more than 3x in recent months. Orders are even more drastic, almost 10x compared to mobile
